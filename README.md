# led-test 

This repository was cloned from the AVR-Rust.

I have changed it a little bit to work with an RGB light.

## Prerequisites

  * A recent version of the nightly Rust compiler. Anything including or greater than `rustc 1.47.0-nightly (0820e54a8 2020-07-23)` can be used.
  * The rust-src rustup component - `$ rustup component add rust-src`
  * AVR-GCC on the system for linking
  * AVR-Libc on the system for support libraries

## Usage

To build the project I made a simple run script.

./run.sh

## Resources

  * The [AVR-Rust book](https://book.avr-rust.com)
